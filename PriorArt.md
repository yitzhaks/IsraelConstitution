The Israeli Knesset website has an extensive [section](https://main.knesset.gov.il/activity/constitution/pages/ConstOpening.aspx) (and [English](http://knesset.gov.il/constitution/ConstOpening_eng.htm)) dedicated to the possibility of legislating a constitution. In there is a [list of previous attempts](https://main.knesset.gov.il/activity/constitution/pages/ConstProposals.aspx) at writing one.<br>
There is also a [page](https://main.knesset.gov.il/activity/legislation/pages/basiclawsandconstitution.aspx) that explains why Israel doesn't currently have a constitution and how Israel has evolved a system of basic laws and rights, which enjoy semi-constitutional status.
